# HEADS UP
Spotify changed their API to include some awesome new features, so they need to be included in this project. The node wrappers have also changed so that needs to be updated too!
# spotibot ðŸ¤–
A Spotify Messenger bot <br> can make the bot an image to make larger
For Mac OS <br> requirments
https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlists/
Need the Spotify desktop app installed and be logged in there
# troubleshooting
Open Spotify Desktop app (Try/Catch, on catch say to download it or open it)<br>
Playlists limit to 50 <br>
Bearer tokens expire after an hour: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlists/
# native spotify settings to test
Turn on autoplay to keep the music going. This will override anything in the queue <br>
Fade in and out
# TODO
- [x] Need to await login before checking what song is playing ie if song is playing before user runs script
- [x] Error checks for http fails, expired bearer token (doesnt work suggest new token or invalid username)
- [x] Need to await the interval function to ensure desktop app is open, if it isn't then throw and error
- [ ] Does it traverse playlist folders? What if the name given is the playlist folder name? Desired playlist in folder? 50 limit?
- [ ] Need to use for npm my version of facebook chat api and pull in recent changes
- [ ] Add config so ppl don't keep queueing closer by chain smokers thanks @jaypatel for the idea
- [ ] If bearer tokens are expired (even if provided correctly earlier) then playlist search fails and script exists
- [ ] Rewrite using API callbacks so it works on any device
- [ ] Priority Queue

If auth gets annoying could have terminal browser pop up to authenticate user
